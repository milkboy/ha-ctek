Totally not a quick hack that may or may not work.

### Prerequisites

- OAuth client credentials
- CTEK account
- ???

- A suitable charger
  - Kindof tested with Njord Go

### Installation

As most custom components (recommended to add as [custom repository in HACS](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/))

### Known issues

Multiple device support not quite implemented. A single configuration / device is currently the only way.
